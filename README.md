🐱🐶 Task 3 – Cat vs Dog Classification Using Machine Learning

This project is part of my internship at **SkillCraft Technology**.  
The objective is to build a binary classification model to distinguish between images of **cats** and **dogs** using traditional **machine learning techniques** (not deep learning).

 📁 Dataset

The dataset is taken from **Kaggle:
[Dogs vs. Cats](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dogs-vs-cats)**.  
It contains thousands of labeled images of cats and dogs in `.jpg` format.

- Images were resized and converted into flattened arrays
- Labels were assigned based on file names

📌 Objectives

- Preprocess and flatten image data using **OpenCV**
- Convert image matrices into feature vectors
- Build and train an **SVM (Support Vector Machine)** classifier
- Evaluate the model using standard classification metrics

🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV – image processing
- NumPy – data manipulation
- Scikit-learn – model building and evaluation
- Matplotlib – visualization

📊 Key Learnings

- Traditional ML can work on image data without deep learning
- How to preprocess image datasets for machine learning
- Importance of feature scaling using **StandardScaler**
- Evaluating ML models using **Accuracy**, **Confusion Matrix**, and **Classification Report**

✅ Results

Achieved accurate classification between cat and dog images using an SVM model, tested on real image data from Kaggle.  
This task strengthened my understanding of ML pipelines applied to visual data.

 📌 Status

✔️ Completed and submitted as part of Task 3 during my internship.
